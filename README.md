# UCI Results Scraper
A WordPress plugin to scrape cyclocross results from the UCI website.

## Do not use

This plugin no longer works. The UCI changed the layout and functionality of their website in 2017 rendering our code useless. 
Some day we hope to pick this back up and get it working again. This was originally part of the [UCI Results](https://github.com/erikdmitchell/uci-results) plugin.
